    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Prepare all ingredients. Heat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C).</li>
        <li>For the crust: Combine cookie crumbs with melted butter in a bowl until well blended.</li>
        <li>Press the mixture firmly into the base of a 9-inch springform pan.</li>
        <li>For the filling: Using an electric mixer, beat the cream cheese, sour cream, and sugar in a bowl until the mixture is smooth and creamy.</li>
        <li>ncorporate eggs one at a time, mixing thoroughly after each. Blend in lemon juice, lemon zest, and vanilla until smooth, scraping down the bowl as necessary.</li>
        <li>Pour the filling over the prepared crust in the pan.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until the edges puff up and the surface is set with only a small wobbly spot remaining in the center when gently shaken, approximately 1 hour.</li>
        <li>Allow to cool at room temperature for about 1 hour, then chill in the refrigerator until fully cold, at least 3 to 4 hours.</li>
        <li>For the meringue topping: Heat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Whip egg whites with an electric mixer until soft peaks appear.</li>
        <li>Add sugar and cream of tartar, continuing to beat until the mixture becomes glossy with stiff peaks.</li>
        <li>Spread the lemon curd evenly over the chilled cheesecake.</li>
        <li>Pile the whipped egg whites on top and spread to completely cover the curd layer.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until the meringue turns golden brown, approximately 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Take out of the oven and refrigerate uncovered for at least 1 hour or up to 1 day before serving. Avoid covering the meringue as it may deflate.</li>
    </ol>
