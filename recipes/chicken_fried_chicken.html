    <p>A kid-friendly chicken dish that's perfect for little helpers. They'll enjoy crushing up the crackers, and don't worry about being exact with measurements - just go with the flow!</p>

    <h4>Ingredients</h4>

    <ul>
        <li>30 saltine crackers</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons dry potato flakes</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon seasoned salt</li>
        <li>Â½ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1 egg</li>
        <li>6 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves</li>
        <li>2 cups vegetable oil for frying</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Add crackers to a large zip-lock bag, seal it shut, and use a rolling pin to crush them into rough crumbs. Mix in the flour, instant potato flakes, seasoned salt, and pepper until combined.</li>
        <li>Whisk the egg in a shallow bowl. Dip each chicken piece into the egg, then transfer to the bag with the crumb coating. Close the bag and shake well to cover completely.</li>
        <li>Preheat oil in a deep fryer or large pot to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Cook the chicken, flipping occasionally, until it turns golden brown and the juices run clear, about 15 to 20 minutes.</li>
    </ol>
